# PINN_Examlples
Solve PDEs with PINN method_deepXDE package 


Here we will gice examples for solving PDE systems using physics informed neural networks. In this repository, only deepXDE is used. But in another repository (Finance), we will use a customary PINN code to solve Black-Scholes equation, and compute ridk factors of markets. <br/> 

We also show how one can use PINN for paramter identification problems. (Agian, paramter identification is used in Finance repository to find the implied volatility of markets).
